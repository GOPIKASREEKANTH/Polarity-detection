"Ã‚Â @rkso6371Ã‚Â Lol, he was not doing any kind of caste in last elections.. Then no general voted for him, it's a good strategy to move to OBC, UC is mad in love of modi",1
"Ã‚Â @rkso6371Ã‚Â Rajeev Gandhi opposed OBC reservation and mandal commission for UCs, But what he got in return zero votes of UC.. so it's better for congress to move to OBC,UC don't vote for congress anymore",1

There are thousands of educated people who can be prime ministers but government policies should be for the employment generation.

Not for party that wants to change the constitution but one that wants to protect it.",1
"Rahul Gandhi has definitely transformed his personality after Bharat jodo yatra,, Hope he will get an opportunity to prove himself this time.. or leaders like Sachin pilot and Shashi Tharoor are also not bad option..",1

Ã‚Â @dhyeepandya8106Ã‚Â An arrogant person like Modi who hasn't even done a proper press conference in 10 years doesn't even mention Kisikana's name in a normal interview....making fun of this long thing....because he has learned that the name will be important. Ban jaayenge...he is so arrogant...even Modi also takes the name of only one person...again and again...he feels compelled to make fun...because of him. We have to take down our reputationâ€¦..because he is the only one who can challenge usâ€¦.every time Pappu keeps saying Pappuâ€¦.why? Why is he important?

"We are all Indians with a common and related civilizational heritage from languages ​​to food to way marriages and ceremonies are conducted, gods and beliefs, our daily lifestyles. Local flavors will always be distinct due to variations of local factors when spread over such a large area, population and timescale. Let us remind ourselves of that and stand for those who give preference to this heritage and commonality to be united against a fractured world. Only we are the last remaining spot of competition and confluence and have been so from the distant past. I urge people to realize that and give it preference over everything else. Nobody or nothing is perfect. But unity and truth will only bring forth the strength in us and the best amongst us. I prefer to see it as Diversity in Unity.
 Politicians, Profiteers and Narrative Spinners who do not want a strong India as it will allow us to take our decisions for ourselves. The power centers of the world will loose their remaining hold over us. Don't let them divide us. Whenever you see people trying to drive wedges between us on region, caste, religion, colour, language and many more stand against them. They are bought stooges and will lead us down in the long run.

In the 2nd sentence, you are speaking the thing that I was trying to explain even with a large economy (3rd largest by PPP) we are still a relatively poor country mainly due to population size.

"@rajesh7280 No one wants to meddle in Indian affairs. People are interested in what is going on in other parts of the world. I personally think that this DW report is not at all too critical about Modi.
 One of the great achievements of modern India since 1948 is that India has always been a democracy. Indians can truly be proud of this. Just compare it to Pakistan or China! In a democracy you must accept that there are different opinions and views. Do you want conditions like in China or Russia? No opposition permitted, and everyone hails the great leader who is elected with 99.9% of the votes and has nearly unlimited power? DW is an independent organization and no one's mouthpiece. You will find lots of critical reports by DW on German affairs if you look around.",1

  How could someone foresee the future and then decide oh this boy will be future CM of the state or PM of the country, let me remember him so that I will be able to 'corroborate' his statement in future.
 
  It's not like he worked in some legally registered and well regulated organization so one can access his records. It was a railway station, hundreds of people work or have worked there and thousands come and go, no one got time to 'corroborate' by recognizing a tea selling boy.",1

Modi will win,1
"Thank you for this! You've done an excellent job, so here's a random voice from India.
 ,
 I see myself in the Prime Minister. I want him to continue for another 5 years. The support is not an oath of blood to the BJP, but wholehearted gratitude for this Prime Minister who loves his country and its people so. Also, being Hindu, I see why they call NaMo the Hindu Hrday Samrat. 
 (The Ram temple was evoked; outsiders looking into India now know how important Shrirama is for the Bharatiyas. Here is a deeper insight into our basic constitution as a people. Lord Ram says in the Ramayana to his brother Lakshmana, ""Api swarnamayi Lanka na My brother, this Golden Lanka does not interest me one bit; mother and the motherland are higher than the highest heavens. 
 ,
 Instead of strengthening the infrastructure and empowering the citizens, the Indian National Congress had mutated into the horrible mess that was finally put an end to in 2014. I was 24 at the time. Dilly dallying in the face of an emergent China, and the final dying embers of Ghazwa e Hind, Modi's choice by the majority is a vehement statement that India is non-negotiable. India must be protected; India must thrive. I'm not persuaded by Rahul Gandhi. The choice of Narendra Modi is an acknowledgment of his service to the nation, and an endorsement of his vision for the country. It's our highest heaven, you see.
 
 PS: If Indian elections, and our choices seem strange, maybe you should look closer. We embrace contradictions. While I love Modiji, I voted for the Congress Candidate this time 2 weeks ago; Raghavettan FTW.",1

India needs Modi's fascism for 25 years at the very least,0
"DW should know that Indians now identify the Communist historians and left political alysts quite easily. This kind of content will never work. Gen Z knows it quite clearly too. :) You Maoists have no space in Indian culture, one piece of faulty and biased constitution can't take away our millenia old culture and social values. India will stay India, one off case of hosting can happen like it happened between 1947 and 2014 but the Indic leader will rule the hearts of Indians for the large amount of time and only that way the indigenous culture can be preserved too.",1
"18:53 ""Pushing for a RAM Temple to be built on the site of a mosque in ayodhya"" seems like a very biased way to say it when the Temple existed well before the mosque. Journalism? Documentaries must be made on how media houses can drive narratives and all subtle examples like these must be explicitly shown.",0
"DW, Germany itself should look at themselves and improve their own country instead of lecturing India. The EU economy is stagnant, native population is on the decline and there is a huge immigration crisis due to which the social fabric of getting disrupted. 
 
 Don't lecture India. We maybe not the best and the richest but we know how to deal with things.",1
He is being sarcastic,1

"Modiji is unbeatable because he is down to earth, because he has a vision and knows how to fulfill that vision, because he is sincere, honest, because he loves Bharat immensely and will leave no stone unturned to take her to her past glory. Modiji has captured the imagination of Bharat because of his virtues and most of the people love him a lot. Western media may try to tarnish his image, but we the people of India will always stand with him and your nefarious attempts will bite the dust.",1

To understand this, one has to learn about the sociopolitical turmoil Kashmir had been going through! The no-man enclaves in Bangladesh border! The parallel economy that Pakistan was running in India etc... etc...! Modi understands the reality of India as he was roaming into every nukes and corners of India as a 'Pracharak' or missionary of RSS for decades! He then served as chief minister of his native state Gujarat for 15 long years before sitting in Prime Minister's chair! That makes him 'unstoppable'!!

Being an NRI myself I do believe that the brand and name India is seen very different compared to pre Modi government. His ability/guts to stand against the likes of some western countries (Canada) and not to bow head; Indian govt. decisions in geopolitics.

Per capita income does not affect much in global stand for a massive country. It is massive despite poor people (who are not particularly poor on PPP scale).

"Today the first phase of election happened and this guy brought such a controversial episode, people should be aware of this channel",1
"I am from west bengal. Gave reference to Pranav Mukharji. Do you know about his work in Bengal. Congress made him finance minister, president but what he did for Congress in Bengal. He never did ground level politics and congress vanished from west Bengal during his era. It was Pranab Mukharjee who destroyed the congress in Bengal. He got much more from congress than he deserved. The constituency Pranab Mukherjee won 4th times consecutively represents 60% muslims and at the end of presidency, he went to nagpur. So kindly don't give reference to Pranab Mukharjee who had no ideology",1
video on government jobs is very good way presented,1
"Brother, how much money do you get from BJP?",1
"Your video seemed to me crazy, you are speaking the language of BJP, we just want freedom from BJP.",0
You can send yourself for money like that. How much BJP has given to you? Unsubscribing your channel. You have praised Rahul Gandhi's hard work.,0
Stop giving false information. Punjab has had best infrastructure in the country for investment since 1980s. Google it before you preach. Google Any random year and Punjab has always been in best three.,1

 First of all, your voice has not stopped me.",0
"Brother, I have followed you for the last 4 years. In every new video, you always become better and better. I have huge respect for you.",1

 Who saw Rahul Gandhi as PM candidate in 2010? 
 And if Rahul works hard then 67 year old Modi works 3x more.",1
How much money did you get for making this video? How many days did the bandobast last?,1
"u are too privileged to understand what does it mean to be on the receiving end..For u guys its not about how much vulnerable human lives become under authoritarian regimes rather everything is JUST great CONTENT and ways to make another video and just think about personal gains, govt no one cares for you kya kya hi farq padhta h kyunki privilige is there to save u but its not the case for everyone..it really matters....make balance and keep the country in darkness..just see the sheer timing of your video ,on the day of phase1 polling.. is this really the right time ? this deception wont work anymore mohak, being intelligent is one thing and being honest is completely another thing..",1
Sorry.. Right now We are more concerned about saving our Home... not Furniture. So plz... Spread awareness not useless issue. So SHUT UP,1
"IMPORTANT â€¼ï¸
 BJP voters don't be overconfident this elections.

"Pls also make a video on Calcutta HC judgment of 25,000 WB state government school teachers to be fired and whole salary since 2016 to be returned within 4 weeks due to illegal recruitment process.

"According to you bjp is using religion tactics and Congress is using reservation tactics but the main point is bjp is not providing any good facilities to hindus than Muslim then how can you say that bjp is supporting hindus more than Muslim but if INC COMES the will give reservation over 80-90% to the SC st OBC but generals will suffer a lot but in bjp leadership, no religion will suffer any problem caused by any policies given by bjp if I am correct please reply me if I am wrong @Lucky-vu6hw",1
Finally found something logical,1
Right,1
"â€‹Â @sanatkajal4589Â It's not nonsense. I hate how BJP is suppressing freedom of speech but after reading the Congress manifesto, I'll probably vote for the BJP for the first time in my life. Two reasons- Congress doesn't seem to have a vision and playing on freebies & BJP is pushing India towards capitalism",0
â€‹Â @EggRoll0301Â same i don't like bjp at all but i am going to give my first vote to bjp because congress gonna destroy future of general candidate by giving 90 percent reservation to lower casts,1
â€‹Â @EggRoll0301Â Can you elaborate how BJP is suspending freedom of speech?,1
"Â @omsatpathy5455Â it's written in such a way that the government can use it whenever it wants. Also, we see blasphemy laws (295A) are being used more and more. As an atheist who was once an activist too, I fear writing against any religion on social media nowadays",1
â€‹Â @suryabhansinghrawatÂ Dont you feel ashamed giving such 3rd class arguments at least present something on the table,0
Because most people in Bihar are eligible for reservation as they belong to same community,1
"Â @kanishkalal77Â see you gave me the answer , if will of the majority of Bihar is for Reservation then Why Would it be problematic to minority? I mean Democracy Right?",0
Â @RottenDudesÂ Just wait bro...whole country will get sick because of modi and rahul,0
"I am not general but I also agree 90%reservation is just too much 
 Just like how BJP is using religion tactics to gain votes, Congress is trying to use this reservation tactic to gain votes. 
 Both are begging
 We really need a new political party",1
Â @Lucky-vu6hwÂ I'm gen but still gonna vote for rahul ....why would Bihar only suffer from 90% reservation? ...it should be implemented in whole india,1
"""Reservation is universal throughout India. This country is using my own taxpayer money to discriminate against me based on caste. It's total insanity.""",1
Â @nghosh87Â He said he'll remove caste reservation Restriction of 50% so he's going to increase it + adding other = 90% like in Bihar 85%.,0
Â @hwhahab8Â hmm i mean most of India does not even pay tax i get what u mean but u see we cant do anything B.R ambedkar wanted to give equality to everyone but in the process he ruined it all for the long run. He kinda became selfish.,0
"Imagine even private sector gets reservation as promised like where to work? Give everything to them, we'll live somewhere else",1
"According to you bjp is using religion tactics and Congress is using reservation tactics but the main point is bjp is not providing any good facilities to hindus than Muslim then how can you say that bjp is supporting hindus more than Muslim but if INC COMES the will give reservation over 80-90% to the SC st OBC but generals will suffer a lot but in bjp leadership, no religion will suffer any problem caused by any policies given by bjp if I am correct please reply me if I am wrong â€‹Â @Lucky-vu6hwÂ",1
"He said 50%, not 90%.
 But even I don't agree with this point too..
 I hate BJP as it is a danger and Congress is a disappointment, but I would choose a disappointment than a danger.",0
â€‹Â @LP-bf9oeÂ Actually that disappointment is more dangerous than the danger you are talking about IMO,0
"Â @cidkagenou2962Â it is best to keep switching them, so that neither stays in power or become a monopoly, so i better switch.",1
Â @LP-bf9oeÂ Then bring any other political party besides BJP and Congress to power,0
Â @hwhahab8Â that’s why 40% poor state top in POOR list,0
"It's a denial of quality to the common public. 
 When u have doctors, nurses who clearly performed better in the merit test, but u intentionally choose someone less meritorious, it's not just about those few thousand meritorious students, rather it's about those crores of people who are dependent on govt facilities for their treatment, it's a denial of good service to common people.",1
â€‹Â @hwhahab8Â Bihar is so developed,1
Think logically 90% resevation their will be no general category..all are equal,1
"â€‹Â @ImcrazyfornarutoÂ Caste politics hoge to civil war ho sakta hai…like what is happening in Manipur….the high court gave a judgment on reservation, because of that it will start a civil war in both communities.",1
â€‹Â @LP-bf9oeÂ Congress has clearly said that it will remove the capping of 50% and increase it according to the population of caste to 85% approx….this thing is very dangerous for the country. ...civil war can happen...like what is happening in Manipur today due to reservation.,0
"Â @Yaman-cu2yiÂ and moreover over if there is so much of category population, then very lesser percentage is in reservation is underrepresentation. And there should be representation at least close to their population.",0
Â @hwhahab8Â whats the situation of bihar the most bimaru state of the country,1
How selfish was Dr br ambedkar any you explain bihari girl?,0
General category will end up demanding a separate nation,1
â€‹Â @KKBOY-ev2qqÂ no on wants reservation man if the casteism will end reservation will also get end,1
â€‹Â @hwhahab8Â and we know how good is bihar economy,1
Â @Lucky-vu6hwÂ I agree we need something new.,1
Like free ration to 80 crore people you are right,1
Those are for garib peoples not everyone is getting it ok and garbage of 70 years will take time to clean it can't be cleaned under 10 yearsâ€‹Â @Iampa1chavanÂ,1
"Â @Iampa1chavanÂ Along with that they are also doing development, infra, actual projects.
 
 BJP is talking about AI, research, industry along with culture, and support.
 
 Congress is talking about Social Justice, Caste Census, etc.
 
 Socialist mindset built over 70 years cannot be removed over a short time, also it is not wrong to support those without sufficient income with ration/ life essentials.
 
 1 lakh is not essential, in fact that is bribing the greed in the voter.
 
 But what would you know :D, if you were to understand that much economy, you wouldn't be asking this question.",1
There is more than Congress and BJP you know!!!,1

 REASONS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF IIT, AIIMS REASONS:-
 
 Who among you people will tell Congress to make AIIMS, IIT? I would say that just by creating an institute, it does not mean that it is normal for the government to open institutes in the country. Under Modi, these IITs and AIIMS have increased in the world university rankings, which means now IITs have reached 140th in the world, whereas during the time of Congress, there were not even a thousand. Funds have to be given to the institute and the work is not achieved just by building institute buildings.

"â€‹Â @rupeshsharma1719Â â€‹â€‹ what is free ration for? What kind of free vaccine, which eradicated Corona, no one knows but it gave harmful side-effects to people, how did 3 crore people get it? Well all of you guys, see the failure of BJP :-
 1. Inflation increased exponentially.
 2. Unemployment increased exponentially.
 3. Divide and rule policy on the basis of religion.
 4. Still there are numerous potholed roads in India.
 5. No importance given to Education sector.
 6. Basic daily needs items like wheat, pulses, LPG cylinder, petrol, diesel, etc. Prices have doubled since 2014.
 7. Population is increasing day by day but Modi Govt. didn't give a damn to this biggest problem of our country. (now don't say what Congress do to curb population increase as we put questions to ruling party i.e. BJP and not the opposition party i.e. Congress. )

Any government in major countries depends on gathering investment, you don't even know such a basic thing. Why doesn't America give all homeless people money then?

If they would come to power, even surviving would become an issue for people in general category (and they tell about to the so-called equality). Congress according to me has a clear policy of winning votes on the basis of dividing people on the basis of their castes which they have been doing for decades since independence. 17:27",1
Congress will not rule but will keep ruining the country's economy and infrastructure. So my vote will go to bjp after watching your video and thanks bro Ã¢Å“Å’,1
Congress has become a joke and Rahul is its biggest clown.... He is not intelligent enough and is completely incompetent to be even a politician let alone the PM of a country like India..... Its high time Congress restructure and get rid of the Gandhi family.... The Gandhi family definitely needs to retire from politics forever because they are of absolutely no use to our country now.,0
So basically there are at least 20 crore poor households and one beneficiary per household leads to an annual bill of 10 lakh crore. That's like 30% of India's total annual budget. This will lead to disastrous economic outcomes and stagnation in the job growth and will promote joblessness.,0

"i was sick off congress before 2014 but this time it's different we should teach bjp a lesson they think they are above the law like rajiv Gandhi and Make a video about RSS who worships Hitler and bjp 2045 manifesto main topics Hindu muslim, Hindu rastra, garv se tight karna, violence, raids, jailing and centralized big scale corruption under the nose and of course godi media",0

Modi has brought out a corrupt leader from the past and has brought out a sadhu leader from the future.,0
Their promise of give 1 lakh each and every to poor women and diploma holder can range from 1 lakh crore to 100 lakh crore. This is a rough estimate but it is obviously very huge amount. Even the GDP of the country is just about 45-50 lakh crore. They want to drown the national in debt,1
Even with all the issues with RaGa I still believe he is a better choice for a PM than Modi.,1
"Good thing about Cong Manifesto: Specifications & seemingly legal guaranteed.
 Bad thing: Short termed. Free money. Towards future Sri Lanka.
 
 Good Thing about BJP manifesto: Long term planning, important issues like Slum development, Environment & Sustainability, Infrastructure etc.
 Bad thing: Just superficial like. No specializations.
 Vote wisely, vote for class-census not caste-census.
 Jai Hind",1
I really liked what Mohak has said... Sometimes you have to move away from a person to make stronger leadership in a team. I hope Congress thinks about it.,1
"After adding more RAM, you told. Now it's working great. Many thanks",1
There is no option in our area other than BJP to give vote...and rather all the parties are small and so I voted for Congress because here in our area this time a good educated and well socially engaging woman is seated...I voted by looking my constituency not looking at Rahul or Modi,1
Why is caste survey so important?,1
I am congress supporter but really congress itself doesn't have any clear strategy to fight BJL,1

 - Removal of article 370 from Kashmir.
 - Taking India towards Digitalization (5-6 days only to get passports and driving license)
 - Fulfilled his commitment by building the most impossible Ram Temple.

"Ã‚Â @VikramKumar-gf4yuÃ‚Â we will identify poor families by using census data 2021 ,and same scheme implements in Brazil called bolsa familia it has positive impact poverty greatly reduced in Brazil , literacy rate in Brazil , and some people started micro and small business in brazil due to freedom to think about future plans and inflation increase due to increase in money supply by example printing more currency if money supply is high decrease in interest rate will further increase inflation,",1

"Bro I show your two videos about popularity of Modi and Congress manifesto...such a neutral (good)explanation.. in that you already cleared the things why people support bjp or Modi because they have given information to public regards all the public welfare. and how they are take the advantage..we all know people want clear communication regarding service or government achievement..in same way congress failed to do. other points also most of the people are below or parallel poverty line in India and government know his basic need same they implemented on ground link nal jal yojna ,ladli betiya,sukaniya yojna Jan dhan yojna , pension in direct account,home , washroom,gas stove..this all comes under people basis need...so of course people will know the government @modi ..it's called Use of resources and clear vision leadership",1

Many people don't know what a reservation is. It is about the representation not the jobs.,1
Because Rahul Gandhi ji is a good team player that's why he looks simple...,1
"Bhai your analysis is always the best and I agree with your point even doing 100% reservation will not be of any benefit people are not actually fighting for job they are fighting for reservation and due to this reason these political parties are electing everyone... To become a developed nation, it is necessary to educate the people, if they do not get a government job then they can earn good income... People looking for government jobs are doing well in private sector.. And you are educated and you have guts to go to your reservation. what will be needed",1
Rahul Gandhi is the prime example of a key problem of India. Parents and Peers pressuring people into a profession they are not interested in.,0
"Priyanka Gandhi has said that people do not do politics for power, and Rahul is such a good person, I am 100% sure that even if Congress elections are won this time, Rahul Gandhi will not become PM. Your analysis is also good, but maximum analysis is old. Does it matter if it does not matter to whom? The simple answer is- ""Anyone""..

nah blood in today's situation general needs representation,1
Ã‚Â @fx_1513Ã‚Â ok but in that case also we need cast census because open category also includes many casts Then we can identify is we achieved some social justice.,1
"Ã‚Â @thenationalist8845Ã‚Â but also we need also reservation in politics in today's situation seats are reserved but those candidates are puppets of political parties so they not working for backward classes and not for their constituencies.
 But If we want to say we don't need reservation in politics then we political parties should get tickets to backward class candidates on open seats and also try to win them then reservation in politics can be removed.",1
Ã‚Â @thenationalist8845Ã‚Â definitely reservation will not solve class problem for that government should get another actions but reservation is important for at least minimum representation of backward classes.,1
Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã‚Â @dhirajmokal1206Ã‚Â A different voting system might solve this. Do a quick search on MPP - mixed party proportional.,1
"Ã‚Â @dhirajmokal1206Ã‚Â ""Backward"" classes are not backward u know
 Economic reservation is better",1
Ã‚Â @fx_1513Ã‚Â general has representation everywhere,1
"Ã‚Â @thenationalist8845Ã‚Â reservation is not ""garibi hatao abhiyan"" it is all about representation and for the economic backward class their are many government welfare schemes and there are not perfect parameters for count economic conditions.",1
Ã‚Â @dhirajmokal1206Ã‚Â yes no we definitely need proper reservation in politics and administration. But what I don't personally agree with is giving away seats in education sector. College seats matter a lot and should be given to those who need it and can make good use out of it.,1
"Representation by force without giving importance to merit??? This is why due to people like You who try to repackage reservation in a new name to make it look cool, India is not growing!! Unless we give pure justice to Merit (without caste bias) India's prosperity will remain stagnant!!",1
"Ã‚Â @adwaitvedant3297Ã‚Â wo ""meritdhari"" reservation is not the cool name representation. Reservation what actually is please see the debates in the constitution assembly while drafting the constitution. Reservation is actually make artificial bubble in it the casts are compete with the fellow casts this is actually reservation but if you get the argument of merit this means you decided that 50% of reserved class are not merit based but they compete with each other and for india bad situation people like you are responsible because they vote the communal government not for development, social justice, education.
 Representation by force is important if we take this responsibility to the beneficial class of society this will never happen.",0
Ã‚Â @adwaitvedant3297Ã‚Â firstly read what's reservation why that's needed . The cast system is not built by me. If you want to say reserved categories are not merit based then you are definitely a beneficial class of society. They are based on merits but they compete with each other.,1

She misled ppl by saying that it was built on agricultural land while even today no one can exactly pin point agricultural land in Bengal. because of the terrain. So we don't know how she got that information. That factory went to Gujarat which was under BJP. BJP had made one clearance window in gujrat i.e. they will buy land and keep it ready so if any one wants to make a factory, it will be quick process. Now BJP also has one clearance window in manifesto for whole India.
 
 
 And then ppl keep on saying BJP only works for Gujarat...... Brother, before BJP's face, they have brought good policies to us, what is BJP's mistake?",1
"Same thing happening with punjab. All factories are going to UP, Gujarat or Maharashtra. All these states are led by bjp.
 Go look at how much UP has transformed.....
 
 In Rajasthan Adani group is building the largest solar pannel system which will be visible from space... This project was given by bjp .... And ppl say that bjp doesn't take care of nature",1
"Ã‚Â @nishthakaushal3798Ã‚Â I went to Mumbai few days back. From locals I got to know that the atal setu was planned by congress in 1980s. After some quick research you can verify it. But they never helped BMC in getting rights for the bridge because of some environment protection department. BJP came into power in 2014 in Maharashtra, Mumbai. They started the project in 2018 and now it is getting complete.... Also keep in mind 2 years of covid.
 
 
 Same is the case with chenab bridge, Kolkata underwater metro, and so on",1
If bjp has done so much work then why are they not asking people to vote on that basis,1
Ã‚Â @nishthakaushal3798Ã‚Â look at their ads..... are you mad? On TV they keep talking about successful policies,1

Congress has eaten the upper caste middle class at its feet since 1990's and today they want to cut the hand that fed them. You log in and vote for PM without hate speech. Never will Congress come to power. Today or tomorrow there will be a new powerful middle class of SC ST OBC. They will finally get what was denied to them for thousands of years.

â€‹Â @Pratik6554Â firstly 50 % reservation is never good give opportunity not result I want all male and female got equal opportunity.

"Â @ManishKumar-rn8jyÂ go and read congress manifesto and tell me in which page did they mention they will bring personal law I have read the entire manifesto didn't even find the word personal law .Women population is 50% so at least 50% reservation in govt jobs not private ones is actually good for the country as female labor force participation rate is already lowest in India now it will encourage them to participate in workforce. And BJP is also giving free ration to 80 cr people, free homes to 5 cr and free electricity.",1

 My personal opinion about you is think of yourself first before identifying others as Stupids. What you are first, you try to find out in others.
 Thank you.",1
"â€‹Â @ravikanthreddy77Â Sir what growth you are talking about? Country is growing no matter the government. Previous govt keep the country in positive growth when whole world was in recession. So your growth point is invalid. Also, this govt sold out counties defense by introducing the agniveer scheme. Hate politics is bad for any country if you read about Hitler rise you will be able to draw similarities which our current state and them. The govt even took donations from the vaccine manufacturer and allowed it to be implemented on millions of people, in case you failed to notice India has seen an increase of 11% in heart attacks alone. They even played with our lives.
 I have a question, assume 2 classes with same students and same subjects but taught by different teachers, one class 1% student scored above 90 rest 99% failed and in other class almost everyone passed but a few scored above 90. Then out of two cases who is better teacher? Obviously the one with more uniform scores. This is what exactly happened in past 10 years rich got richer and poor got miserable. Half of the country's assets were sold to 2-3 guys. All national agencies are misused. Hunger Index, media freedom, Passport ranking etc are all dropping and you say this development? The bills in parliament were passed without debates, media sold out is this the right direction? Hate among people is at all time high. Every protest is labeled as anti-India, manipur is burning from past 1 year, farmers were forced to sit on roads for 1 years just to repeal laws which were forced onto them, meanwhile they were labeled as Khalistani's, Anti-National etc etc. Is this the dream country you want to leave for your children? I remember when, a terrorist attack happened in Pakistani School, entire India felt the pain that's how beautiful the people of our country were back then. Now, some much hate is spread in them, that people rejoice and laugh at innocent children deaths. Sorry, If you think this is the development you want then will all due respect you still is in slavery mindset who doesn't question the govt. No press conferences in 10 years. 1% of population controls 70% of country wealth that's how bad the situation is right now. Economic survey is a must to get the data so that correct policies can be formed to help the needy one. Govt job is to work for the needy not for the Adani like Modi is doing. Large no of government schools were closed leaving lakhs of unprivileged children without education. Every village used to have a govt school so that needy can go to them now they were closed. What about their education? You and me are capable enough to sent our children in good schools but what about those who earn 100 a day? How will they afford to sent their child to a govt school 10 km away as their local one is closed?
 A country is from the people, if people are empathic, beautiful souls a country will flourish and if hate is sown then Pakistan is the best example what will happen to that country. Pakistan and India started together with common origin people, but they focused on hate and religion and we focused on our own people and the result is what we all can see.
 If you have time, listen to Pakistani intellectual who tell exact mistakes which they (Pakistan) made in past. Then you will realize what they did in past is what we are doing now.
 Vote for someone who holds democratic values ​​not the one who is destroying it.
 Btw, if you don't know Modi govt passed a law back in 2020 allowing private companies to approach DM's of a district to acquire land at govt rates for that company. So, if you own a land and some company/powerful individual has an eye on it, then they can forcefully take it from you at rates far below market rate. As, DM will acquire the land at govt rates (collector rates) which are usually 1/10th of market rates.",0
"Â @navjeetsingroha7298Â so, you mean to tell others to vote for Congress? 
 In my opinion privatization is a good measure. 
 
 Tell me which party is good and want to develop the nation?",1
"Â @ravikanthreddy77Â Sir, I heard this a lot that privatization is good and all that stuff but how excess of everything is bad, excess privatization leads to crony capitalism which is as bad as socialism.
 Also, Sir I failed to understand, why someone never asked the question on how to increase the efficiency of a govt organization? If a private company can work efficiently with generating huge profits for the owner then why can't a govt agency do at least break-even? Also, if LIC and SBI could do well then why not others? Why the focus is always on to sell stuff rather than fixing it? A recent example, till the time Air India was govt owned other private players kept the prices reasonable as they were competing with a govt organization and after it was sold the air tickets went up. So, if govt focused on improving the flaws in Air India, then these things will not happen.",0

"Dictatorship is better for us compared to democracy.
 
 Democracy never works! It's a weak system of governance. You cannot have democracy all the time. Sometimes, you have to make bold decisions for which you cannot use democracy. You MUST use dictatorial means. Western-style democracy simply cannot work in India because Indians in general are different people. For democracy to work efficiently, people must be enlightened and disciplined, which Indians in general are not. So, to keep people in line, autocracy or dictatorship is needed.
 
 Another problem with democracy is that the governance can never become mature because it keeps on changing after every 5â€“10 years. We need to get rid of democracy and only have one single government and allow that government to mature a bit. It normally takes 15Ã¢â‚¬â€œ20 years for a government to start maturing. You need real professionals to run a government and not immature and emotional people who are unintelligent and make sectarian remarks to get some leverage and influence.
 
 In dictatorship, there's no opposition which means no obstacles. Your governance and its procedures can run seamlessly. The government can easily make bold decisions and things get done a lot faster in a dictatorship plus there are less or no political fights. Everyone agrees to one thing and no time gets wasted in useless quarrels thereby accelerating decision-making and spurring developmental work.
 
 Democracy is also not safe for India. We must try to minimize democracy and maximize autocracy. And by the way, democracy is defined by international rule-based order controlled by America.

Ã‚Â @technostars7981Ã‚Â Okay tell me what baseless arguments I gave? Second did I say Muslims are better?,1
"Ã‚Â @technostars7981Ã‚Â Are you economist?Or just learned that from Youtuber? India has some million plus temples that did make us Rich we are one of the worst GDP per capita country why didn't economically rich countries build temples instead they invest in research and development, supply chains, innovation,skilled,semi skilled labor maybe they should learn from vishwaguru temple builders who built temple from their own money and continue to get lowest living standards and some 25k crores that they just made up.",1
"Ã‚Â @AveragepoliticsEnjoyerÃ‚Â but I agree with your one point that developed countries spnd money on R&D
 
 in india govt waste it on hajj subsidy,madarsa subsidy,giving aid to palestine,etc..
 If 25000 crore economy generated by ram mandir is spent on R&D then india can easily surpass them but sadly it will be wasted on muslim appeasement!",0
Ã‚Â @technostars7981Ã‚Â Okay tell me how Ram temple gonna generate 25k crores Jobs employment? I agree stop wasting money whatever unnecessary.,1
Ã‚Â @technostars7981Ã‚Â I read it just estimation nothing concrete it's just trust me bro we will see how ayodhya gets developed by ram mandir.,1
"Ã‚Â @AveragepoliticsEnjoyerÃ‚Â here you came with another baseless argument (as usual) how much do you think estimates will go up and down? And secondly Ayodhya is getting infrastructure, airport, hotels, etc.
 
 Last but not least. It is built from our money not from your money.",0
Ã‚Â @AveragepoliticsEnjoyerÃ‚Â not just Hajj subsidy. In delhi a maulvi gets 18k per month and in other states aswell. And dont forget aid given to p@lest!n. These things add nothing to economy,0

"Ã‚Â @AveragepoliticsEnjoyerÃ‚Â your assumption is based on your own speculation and hated thats why u are even ignoring the analysis of economists.
 BTW temple was built from donation of hindus not from taxpayer money. So carry on your fake news,hatred,and baseless arguments, you cannot change fact with your strawmen and fallacies.",0
Ã‚Â @technostars7981Ã‚Â You literally do whataboutery and bring Muslims in every topic first learn how to write arguments no economist had said Ram mandir generating money and second is it was illegal to demolish mosque but it was done to please majoritism.,0
"Ã‚Â @AveragepoliticsEnjoyerÃ‚Â you proved my point that you people cannot debate on facts and give baseless arguments. You dont know sbi you dont know who is the best economist of the world 2024.
 
 And I dont do whataboutery I answer all your baseless argument and you cant answer even one of my logical ques thats why refraining from it by calling it whataboutery.
 How much money that ""illegal mosque"" added to Indian economy? That ""illegal masjid "" was protected by govt only to please islamists",1
Ã‚Â @technostars7981Ã‚Â How's that illegal it was created before existence of India constitution courts and supreme court has said demolition of it was crime but to please majority cartoon worshipers mandir was created who is best economist literally you don't have any understanding of economics because there isn't a best economist in the world.,1
Ã‚Â @technostars7981Ã‚Â The temple is created to please majority hinduist who are so proud of cartoons characters and mythology.,1
Ã‚Â @AveragepoliticsEnjoyerÃ‚Â you can make yourself happy with your lies and avoid my questions. But I will again repeat my ques:- how much money that illegal mosque which was symbol of terror was contributing to Indian economy?,1

 3. Gandhi family, there are many good people who can represent Congress. Sachin pilot, Revanth Reddy, many others who have clarity than Rahul Gandhi. E.g. BJP is making a new big thing as Annamalai.
 
 Additional point, no one (both BJP and Congress) is taking about how to revive water, nature and sustainable population growth.

 Under BJP time from 2014 to 2024 in spite of covid crisis inflation is 5% (for this you can refer IMF data)

 4, on one hand he accuses Adani, on the other hand Rajasthan Gehlot government makes tie ups with Adani group.

"The CPSE comparison is unfair if you are not controlling for number of PSUs- BJP pushes for privatization.

Instead hand waving arguments, you need to explain direct indirect effects to laymen. These are the nuances where the laymen could benefit from your economic expertise.
 Similarly, comparing reservation for locals to caste/religion based one is pointless.
 When you are showing csds survey and talking about inflation, didn't you think you should also dispel doubts about increasing inflation comparing numbers!!!

No way this will happen. Also, private sector reservation will ruin the country in a different way. If the companies wont have the power to decide who to hire based on their skillset, they can choose two paths - outsource the bulk of their labor to countries where such issues aren't there and automation.

 Criticizing is easy and cheap, but it takes work to actually do sound research. My suggestion is instead of flying off the handle ridiculing any party, esp.

You're underestimating the below poverty line population in India. A huge chunk of the population depends on TV news which is clearly biased to a level. Most of the older population too depends on TV.,1
And there's a ton of YouTubers having content clearly on conservatism.,1
"Take it this way, have you ever seen a critic showing the things that good in there? It's not how it works, the critic provides the main subject with questions and demands for answers. That's how it works, it's the same thing with politics. Oppositions aren't there to eat water soaked dates, they hold the power to criticize the government on their doubts.",1
"Druv Rathee provides the voters with questions, we as civilians should ask. It's democratic rights. It depends on the maturity of the audience how they will take it. The sad thing is, most people just doxx him without even understanding or considering the critisisms, in which he's pretty true.",1
"Ã‚Â @PAWANKUMAR-ed3ugÃ‚Â A healthy chunk of the population does prefer news, like these biased ones. Even in mobile. And a lot in a lot of states, TV is just an essential. 
 I do agree, Druv Rathee is a businessman, he's a YouTuber afterall. But the whole thinh that he's proposing has been in term for a long time. And it is not provided the actual importantance it deserves. I mainly used the term government as the ruling party. And that's the point. Only the ruling party can make a change in a national level. There's not much reason to diz oppositions at this point.",1
Rahul gandhi should leave politics and should get married & get settled in Italy,1
He is giving false info about problem with existing reservation,0
How much money you got from bjp to speak against congress,1
"And this is true, Modi ji is sending public from India to Pakistan in 2024.",1
These Rahul's ancestors are Muslims. So congress will work for behalf of muslims not be half of Hindus and country,0
Your knowledge is useless cause you have spent your time and skill to evaluate this dustbin we call it Pappu,0
Congress free India,1
"The country will be ruined brother, just search how much budget expenditure the government has to spend just to give pension. The law is such that even MLA and MP do not get pension.
 If pension is not given then loan is given in 2-5 percent then one learns to open a business after retirement and people and government also do not feel much loss and this money should be spent in education, science, sports.",1
If you read the Congress manifesto then you will feel guilty if you start voting for Congress.,0
"Even if bjp had 100 problems..it doesn't matter as long as they are keeping the financial health, healthy",1
But still congress is far better than BJP,1
sorry to say but you have worst research team because facts are missing.I have witnessed a very nonsense video ever,0
"RaGa showing lollipop of reservation and khata khat 1 lakh. But he is unaware about public, no one believes him and his party.
 
 BJP is good choice among both, as they work on capital investment along with social welfare. And Narendra Modi credibility is a biggest reason as central government worked on almost all promises of their manifesto.",1
Just to please Modi bhakts you are doing all this Mohak... very sad to see that you no longer support the truth... this will lead to your downfall not get you best creator award,1
"90 percent reservation as written in the manifesto, it's fake.",0
Never vote to congress to save our beloved India.,1
There is no good option to vote for.,0
If you tell me directly to your father then you will leave your father.,1
we gave 60 plus years to congress we understood their capabilities other than appeasement and divide. next there is no good leader in opposition do u want to c lalu s son to be next finance minister and akhilesh yadav as union minister in external affairs so think and vote,0
Your study is weak son. The country needs Congress now,0
"When will you make a video on Modi? Or you will not talk about jobs, when will you give jobs to the poor?",0
It is easy to speak only on Rahul Gandhi.. whenever I see someone speaking against Modi.. a media worker has given the log to BJP.,1
"Hey you idiot, you are seeing all these points of Rahul, you are not seeing what Modi says.... If you see then you will understand who is right and who is wrong.",0
"Friend Rahul Gandhi, old issue has been raised, what new has been said?",1
Both BJP and Congress is not good for India and its a fact. we want a good party rather than bjp and congress,1
"You have already told me about Modi government that you will not see! Why don't you say anything against your father, waaahh.. and this is a matter of comparison, at least BJP did not impose emergency to save its seat.. like coward Indira.",0
"Brother, it means no true words to those who belong to BJP.",0
"The government has put Rs 173 lakh crore in the graveyard. I have not been able to do this yet, I have been forced to do so in India.",1
bjp might have problems but i cannot cast my vote to a person who talks like that in public just imagine him representing india in the UN i mean he has no vision bas ek baari pm ki seat par bethna h he has nothing planned for india to actually make it grow,0
"no doubt Rahul is a gud soul ...,thts y respected and loved by his mother and her sister.......we can't forget his family's contribution and sacrifices to india....for sure modi will win this election by using EC in his hands.....but modi can't win thousands of hearts and their prayers like him........he already a winner of hearts so winning or losing the election is not a matter at all for him......but he already wins more than 100 thousands of indian citizens heart by his bharath jodo yathra till now he is loved by all......Rahul is a silver spoon born so he never run for money or fame or for position like modi or Amithshaa, he just want to serve people like his father and grandmother, great grandfather Nehru ji....he just trying to serve people of India in any way possible he could do like his father.....when u compare both modi and Rahul.....Rahul gandhi is loved by his family and by the people of india too but when u take modi - his family members hate him they don't even want to take his name in their mouth bcoz of his character....his own family never liked to meet him once this much hated he is getting from his family and by the people of india",1
This is better than Modi,1
He has literally made a lot more videos criticizing BJP. Lol you guys are so dumb.,1
Much better than Modi who actually wants to India United,1
"Brother, don't do it with such love and affection.",1
"Nice, but whether it is mentioned in manifesto or not one important point is Atmanirbhar in defense sector and foreign policy. BJP is the clear winner in these two and are very important for the country.",1
What will happen from free will people want less to go to the country or their own development let's hope that their benefit will come because it is not just for few people so for BJP - 9/10 or congress - 4/10 free is dangerous then it is for no good. no amount happened,1
People saying BJP hardworking is like the shitty journalists asking Modi how do you not get tired working for the people. It's obvious he only works for 2 people Ambani and Adani. And thankfully he has a lot of andhbhakts who can't think of read,0
"Brother, today I watched your video for the first time and I subscribed to it.",1
"BJP manifesto is much clearer than Congress manifesto. Country has limited budget, you cannot throw money to solve all problems. There is something called capex and opex which I think congress doesn't understand.",1
Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã‚Â @pratyakshasrivastava6611Ã‚Â The cycle of free food which could not be achieved in 40 years will eliminate poverty in one go.,1
"Everyone is the same sir. No matter how many promises you make, you don't make any promises.",1
More people are facing the camera and propaganda is being spread.,1
Vote for a nuclear free nation. Vote for minority reservation and wealth distribution. Vote for peaceful relations with neighboring countries. Vote for INDIA.,1
Ã‚Â @VatsalPlaysValorantÃ‚Â that is the best thing that they have done. Reservation is not a free fish. Privatization without competition is.. I have woke up. It's our time,1
"Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã‚Â @spark6885Ã‚Â Modi's speech of gold coming out from the sky was repeating Rahul Modi's words and that video was edited and put on IT cell, I have not seen the original video.",1
Ã‚Â @nishanthkharvi967Ã‚Â They are increasing reservation also. Wake up. Say No to giving free fishes. Say yes to teaching how to fish. BJP onlyâ€¦,1
"Brother, ask Congress from where it will get so much money to distribute.",1
"Ã‚Â @KARAN__SAPRE--------55Ã‚Â Bro, it would not have happened just by supporting him, the story would have been done on his principles.. or you would have said that you are a devotee..",1
"You also made a lot of promises in Punjab election, then after winning the election the Center gave funds, then again you gave the same promises Congress made in Karnataka, there is no fund after winning the elections............. .Godi media that is BJP media or it cell is so pathetic that it did not cover. Punjab's farmer movement, teacher movement, money to woman, etc. should also be learned from unbiased Ravish Kumar, Dhruv Rathee, Abhisar Sharma, Arfa, Ajit, etc. 2002 Gujarat riots, main gaya sabarmati train burning or false propaganda or Hindu. does that......",0
"Open Letter brother make video on gujarat 2002 riot movie bhi aa raha hain ..........unbiased media only talk on 2002 gujarat riot but quiet on sabarmati train burning , either they electrical fault ,hindu sangathan does that and put blame on muslim..........does muslim woman stops the water tanker to reach the train tooo..... .dors lalu prasad railway minister made committee and the result it was electrical fault tha made the whole boogey burn......if u see this comment and have time please made a detail vdeo........thanks in advance..",1
"I think it is also true that if we improve our old skills instead of acquiring any new skills, I have a society where I am or if the promises of Congress are fulfilled then the country will run for 5 years. I don't know that the situation of 1992 will be there again. Jaye or iss bar hmare pass Dr. Economist like Manmohan Singh is not available or his more then 50% reservations or 50%for women or Muslims are added to the obv section, what will happen to the general after that he will not be able to get a government job or wealth distribution will also happen. What would happen if there were any party that would defeat BJP or Congress and if they would vote for us, then now BJP is there, anyway BJP has created AIMS in my district, if we have built good roads and highways in the airport, then we have got one more term. I said that Ram Mandir 370 triple talaq cannot be forgotten and BJP's major promise has been fulfilled over the years so once again BJP is right.",1
BJP is good for both country and people. Congress may be for people I too am not sure.,1
Ã‚Â @keshavatkan1Ã‚Â so u want article 370 back n see more terror attacks in India ? U want instant triple talaq back n want to see Muslim women to suffer? Wealth distribution will be applicable on hindus not in waqbord on congress parties not on cruch. N giving every thing for free means from where they regenerate money? No discussion about infrastructure in manifesto every thing is giving free n giving imp to Muslims who r majority in minority people why not buddhist why not jains?,1
"BJP is also giving free food to 80 crore people, due to which they are getting votes in UP, Bihar, MP.",1
It's BJP brother. 2 years of Congress's false manifesto will all be thrown out.,0
"As freebies of congress are unsound and unsustainable, and one thing congress is old party and they should change the face of congress like a person who is intelectual, logical and talented rather than pappu. Because as govt is important at the same time strong opposition is also important to turn down the monopoly of govt and criticize there policies practically. Coming to conclusion right now BJP seems a good option.",1
Brother u was wrong about the train service currently as India becomes no 1 in population here 80 crs people can live without any problem but we all are 145 crs + so we have to do struggle for resources and job as well,0
"BJP has the better vision.
 please ask Modi ji to rescue us because the situation in West Bengal is terrible.
 pls ask PM to put Mamata Banerjee behind the bars.",0
"Calling out on lads blindly following a leader like it's some cult is indeed these so called ""Andhbakt"". The thing is, some people don't really understand what makes it different from a ""BJP supporter"". It's not just a BJP thing, it's stereotype.",1
"The fact is polarization is very bad, no one wants to listen to anyone's talk.",0
Ã‚Â @Kaal3339Ã‚Â Government thieves on the people's mindset and knowledge. And I believe every individual should know both the negatives and positives of a government to consider voting. There's our media if you're looking for the positive outlook. He's doing what the opposition failed to do.,0
Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã‚Â @JurozaitenÃ‚Â so u r agree on the point that droov is negative side of government so the things that godi media are doing is also important and we should not criticize them to be baised.,1
Come let's debate. Call par. You will reply to number Dunga. The fun will come and then we will find out. Who are the blind devotees+ brainwashed - BJP only,0
I thought I was blind.,0
"Maturity when you realized ""Jo subah shamm eats 1/2 kg cow dung"" you did not know what was going on at the root level in the country.",0
Absolutely correct just like my friend who is forwarding German shepherd what'sapp University Ã¯Â¸Ã¢~ Ã¯Â¸,1
"You forget that, education is important",1
Ã‚Â @pushpendraroy1863Ã‚Â If you talk on the facts then your face will also make people laugh. He will call you a devotee and you will use spoon. What is there about development in this?,1
I agree that there are devotees in BJP but the one who only supports Dhruv is also a devotee. In reality no one can ever be completely right or wrong.,0
What will be the condition of these poor people and they will cry again on 4th June?,0
"Andhbhakt because these people bring the ideology of blind faith into politics, and the consequences for the same are clearly visible in a quote by Dr Ambedkar. Going deep down, what BJP uses today, is the HINDUTVA ideology, NOT the essence of HINDUISM. And if people have problems with others celebrating or inculcating their own beliefs, then understand that we ourselves have failed in upholding the true essence of SECULARISM.",0
Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã‚Â @JurozaitenÃ‚Â do you know about your cultural things. How much do you know about Indian culture? So when a party use this and make popular our culture that makes devotees. Wow bro if your mom do best things for you with the money of corruption then you become a andhbhakt right,1
The work of all political parties is like this. There is no hope. But bjp parties is good for me,1
Ã‚Â @GamingSoumyadeepBarariÃ‚Â Nahi bhai.. everyone is sensible in front of Modiji.. do not use your mind more in front of God..,1
Maturity is when you realize people criticize others without criticizing themselves first,1
This is about maturity. seriously,0
"Ã‚Â @JurozaitenÃ‚Â if congress comes to power India will become Zimbabwe. Bcoz same manifesto like congress implement by Zimbabwe president when he came to power, he took properties and wealth of white people and distributed to black people, after that their whole economy collapsed bcoz black people were not able to generate wealth from what they got for free bcoz they were not skilled. And white people who were having skills had no money left. So a government should put effort to make their population a skilled people instead of giving freebies and disturbing wealth creators.",0
Reality is when you question an andhbhakt as to why are they supporting they have no specific reason or answer most of the time they goof up and tries to avoid answering and escape from it. But when you ask any devotee they will give you a reasonable answer.,1
"dam even I hear of this and discuss with one of my muslim barber but what he said I lost my mind but stood quit and said yes yes you are right but inside me I was dam shocked to see this man I used to know as a liberal Speaks this way he is telling me that BJP has been ruling on father's money in the last 50 years, Congress has done little and mocked me. I told you that you are speaking like this as if the country is owned by Congress and who is the owner of Congress? I don't have any chance of getting a mile then brother, if I give you the color then I will feel like walking again.",0
"Guys, you should know that freebies is not a good means of governing a country. It will put India in a huge debt, cause inflations, good and services prices will be all time high. Anyway, it's just bad. People will be happy at first but then it will all crumble down. Congress is also saying it mend relations with Pakistan which is obviously not a nice thing to do and we've already seen consequences of it (26/11). I am not an andhbhakt but bjp manifesto aligns more with my ideology.",1
"Ã‚Â @imaViraXÃ‚Â hey bro what is bad in good relation with pakistan , you say free money is bad for economy but war is good wow andhbkt",1

"Ã‚Â @muhammedjaseemshajeef6781Ã‚Â giving them authority to govern their own land will hamper the Border development and they can be easily bribed by china for it, Don't forget Ladakh is also in Pak",1
"Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã‚Â @muhammedjaseemshajeef6781Ã‚Â Bhai do you also know what is the difference between 6th schedule and 5th schedule? If you don't know how much I know, please tell me. Environment protection and industrial development can never go together. If the 6th schedule comes to Ladakh then even basic development cannot be borrowed, since there is already a ban on road infrastructure on the opposite side of China. If we do not do any development then it will be difficult to protect our own area from China. Did you not understand from above that China wants clean water (glacier water) for semiconductor chip development, and at present, due to global warming, it is using the water extracted from the glacier free of cost, whereas This water can be used by India itself in chip development. So understand why the 6th schedule does not exist. And I am hopeful that the central government will find a middle path without destroying the minimum environment.",1
Ã‚Â @TharunTamilvananÃ‚Â everything is wrong everything free free lakhpati didi is one of the best thing I heard in BJP manifesto.,1

Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã‚Â @Saby511Ã‚Â so so i guess people are more free under DMK and TMC what do you think about that?,1
Ã‚Â @rupasharma7267Ã‚Â u misunderstood see my second comment... The 1st question itself answers that we r better now than we were before 2014. Also the wealth distribution congress manifesto is talking about is of their inheritant taxation.,1
Bcoz your all generation used perks of reservation. Coming from middle class general category. We deserve reservation. Congress giving good as per current policy,1
Congress is the enemy of OBC. 2012 main OBC quota was given to Muslims.,1

"Do you think division of a country in the name of religion is good?
 Do you heard anything about electroral bond scam?
 Do you aware of last ten years huge loans from IMF and IBRD?
 Haven't you seen the violence in Manipur?
 A Chief minister arrested on account of fifteen lakh rupees but a chief minister like Mamata Banerjee who looted thousands of crores of rupees in West Bengal is free, great Modi ji!
 Don't forget the Raffle scam
 Nirab Modi, Vijaya Maliya.....
 So, this is our 'acche din'",1
"Hinduism has already done it to divide me in caste, but laws have been made to end the discrimination that has happened or is happening on the basis of caste in every field, if only a few educated people understand the Constitution. Abhi ye statement deke unpadha ghawar lg rhe ho, jese history, economics, general knowledge kya hota hai, pata hi nahi.",0
"Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã‚Â @sapnasolanki29Ã‚Â general category people also get govt. Ko post & pre matric scholarship, the rest should be given the benefit of the scheme like SC ST OBC. Rakshan should be for all communities. The basis of attraction should not be based on economic basis. Equal marks creation / Creamy layer / economic base system should be done. In the country, not every general category person is rich, not every SC/ST person, OBC person is poor. General category people are most exploited in the country and do not get the benefit of any scheme/scholarship in the name of high fees/tax. Govt. Instead of dividing and ruling on caste basis, there is a need to work together with everyone. If we believe that caste discrimination is wrong in the country then the government is for it. Freebies instead of free fukat scheme, good education should be done, work should be done on legal system. PWD/women reservation is still fine.",1
"Ã‚Â @rajsrivastav6940Ã‚Â did he explicitly say that or are people just reading between the lines? I don't think he called all Muslims infiltrators, he just said that some are. And why should resources be distributed on the basis of religion? Religion is not like race, people will just convert into Muslims if there is economic incentive to do so. Just look at how some actors have been converting to Islam to practice polygamy. You simply cannot have two sets of laws and rules in the same country. It is not good for any of the communities and creates more differences not less.",1
"Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã‚Â @antareshmondal7157Ã‚Â so you are saying asking votes on caste basis is correct.
 Liquor scam is correct 
 Dhiraj Sahu (biggest cash raid of India) was also right
 What happened in SandeshKhali was right
 We want a country where the answer to Pulwama is given by surgical strike..not that there is peace after Mumbai attack. 
 Where there is economic boost there is no corruption
 Where IITs and IIMs do not get freebies",1
"Ã‚Â @antareshmondal7157Ã‚Â bro we all know parties will always do something or the other for attracting SCs and STs but by seeing Congress Manifesto everyone can point out that caste is there priority that's what am saying.
 Secondly I personally feel some reservation for Economically weaker sec. is a good move because they are the one who deserve it not those caste who are earning good still using reservation..and as a student i can confirm not much difference in their cut-off unlike caste based.
 Then about Jai Shah bro everyone wants their children to get a powerful place but at least we are assured that our beloved pm is not in favor of such things (and even yogi ji) unlike parivaar vaad parties like Congress and samjavadi party.
 Actual difference lies there only, Modi ji has struggled in his life, became cm of a state 3 times and then became our pm but Congress wants a 0 political knowledge man to become pm who didn't even win his own seat Amethi",1

Talking about washing Congress made Yasin Malik a hero who committed that he murdered many kashmiri pandits, Indian officers and supported criminal activities. So it's just a tit for tat so (same same but different) all are washing machines just the brand is different. Even now u can see IND Alliance saying if we come to power first Modi and Amit will be in Jail.",1
"Ã‚Â @ToolsNinja-ct7jiÃ‚Â first of all my recent had started a few years ago.
 But is it my answer? I don't think so!
 If what Congress had done, BJP will do the same things than how ""acche din"" will come. Isn't it?
 Do you not think to provoke people in the name of religion is a crime?
 If you have forgotten the leaders who provoked the people to demolished Babri Mosque, I can help you to recall the names.
 If Rahul Gandhi can't be the leader of INC than how Jai Shah become secretary of BCCI?
 Why not Mamata Banerjee and her cabinet ministers behind the bars?
 What about the CM of Assam and his Saradha scam? 
 If you are eyeing to cross 400 then why they are incorporating corrupt opposition leaders in BJP?
 Do you have any answer?",0
Ã‚Â @antareshmondal7157Ã‚Â bro that's what I exactly mean.. it's just the choice of bad vs worst. Am not defending every action of bjp but I still know that if not 'acche din' then at least we got 'behtar din'..and about religious politics in 2010 Rahul said Kattar Hindus are more dangerous than Islamic aatankvaadis and same types of thoughts were spread by different Congress leaders. These are the patriotic leaders who ask to give proof of surgical strike and will keep quiet after Mumbai attack and Kashmiri Pandits exodus,0
"Ã‚Â @ToolsNinja-ct7jiÃ‚Â I am not a supporter of INC because I follow the Left ideology.
 In our state Mamata Banerjee sells government jobs and BJP leaders protecting her. That's why I hate BJP.

Ã‚Â @antareshmondal7157Ã‚Â bjp leaders protecting their opposition leader Mamta? Sounds strange but I really haven't heard about it before,1

"Same here, I'm obc but I don't support ""reverse caste based discrimination"" or unfairness to any deserving skilled talented ppl just coz they born in certain category they have no control over, it would be better it reservation or scholarships, aids were on the basis of financial condition of families instead of caste based.",1

Smart decision. It is important to vote for a party that thinks for the long term instead of playing vote bank politics.,1
"Ã‚Â @muhammedjaseemshajeef6781Ã‚Â it is his choice. Congress should stop making its manifestos based on caste if it wants people to stop voting on caste. Modi says I will build roads, airports, bullet trains. He says I will give social welfare schemes to poor people. But Congress only knows how to demonize Brahmins and other similar communities. Today's Brahmins or Rajputs etc. are not responsible for their ancestors actions just like today's Muslims are not responsible for theirs.",0
Even after taking EWS I am not happy bhai sir,0
"Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã‚Â @sapnasolanki29Ã‚Â andpad women, in the country every general category wala is not rich, nor every sc st or obc wala is poor. Political parties all play the victim card of religion and caste's divide and rule. The basis of attraction in the country should not be economic status, creamy layer, equal marks should be created. Govt. One should work on good education, health and employment instead of freebies. Discrimination is wrong, laws for it can strengthen education.",0
"Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã‚Â @sapnasolanki29Ã‚Â SC, ST, OBC people get the benefit of reservation in the name of post/pre matric scholarship, food, free free scheme. What do general category people get the most? General category students get the most exploitation, they get more fees than TAX. Any economic base does not work for everyone. SC ST OBC people get admission job in good marks. Because of the General Category Tax, you are facing illegal charges.",1
Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã‚Â @sapnasolanki29Ã‚Â Attraction should also be for general category people.,1
"Ã‚Â @sapnasolanki29Ã‚Â Hi, first of all idk think general are againts reservation just we demand economic reservation as many obs sc are quite rich they can afford the fees easily, whereas some brahmin is poor but they did not get any help from gov to educate their children. In my view only right education & exposure is a solution of any type of discrimination. May be you get my point!",1
"Ã‚Â @muhammedjaseemshajeef6781Ã‚Â Yes nice joke, that Congress Manifesto is unachievable but also dystopian instead of utopian.",1

pls look at some remote village and see how people actually live.. i have heard Rahul Gandhi's speeches he promises 1 lakh to women of BPL families who according to government earn 2200 rs for whole month. So go out of the bad forest and go to the houses of backward people in Bihar or anywhere in a remote village and you will find that your freebie is a lifeline for someone.

"�@AtheistIndian2024�

Data shows Modi�s 10 rule is far better than UPA�s 10 years rule and when opposition parties use Muslim appeasement politics and caste politicis as tool why do you accuse BJP of using Hindu religion as a tool ?  Dividing Hindus on caste lines and uniting Muslims on religious lines has been the statagey of congress party since beginning . Just see how Raul Vinci is doing divisive caste politics in bharat Jodo Yatra . Former PM Manmohan Singh said Muslims have first right on the resources of India . Didn�t Godhra train burning tore the fundamental nature of society?",1
"�@KumarK-cn1sj� Stop cherry picking statement, I bet u youself never listened to the statement and in what line he was saying that 
Manmohan Singh was far better pm than modi atleast he was questionable and answerable for his actions Uttrakhand passed such a regressive law regarding the living relationships and no one is questioning and no one is answering it or opposite people are justify by illogical arguments
Congress is also a political party and if BJP could divide hindu muslim by making up fake issues then why not congress do so by real issues of caste discrimination when the power is in the hand of an organisation who continuously deny caste discrimination and speak against the reservation and demonise BR Ambedkar
BJP workers themselves pee and grape dalit people
Remember India will end up broken if this type of government continue to control every aspect of life that what are u eating what are u wearing whom are u with in bed 
America Japan Dubai are developed because they accept multiculturalism and plurism but we are accepting extremism and we all know the result",0
"�@AtheistIndian2024� 

Iamnot cherry picking statement of Manmohan Singh , I listened him saying Muslims have first right on the resources of India  . Manmohan might be a good economist but as a prime minister he was no where as good as Modi and attending press conference doesn�t make anyone better PM .  During his tenure  , Hindu terror bogey myth was created where Hindus were framed in blasts that were carried out by Muslims . They planned to bring communal riots bill to target Hindus for Muslim votes , they appointed lawyers who argued lord Ram is a myth in court .  Uttarkhand didn�t pass anylaw regarding living in relationships , it passed uniform civilcode according to which people who live in relatiships must get registered . What�s regressive in it ?  Instead of appreciating Uttarkhand govt for bringing UCC you talk about such insignificant issue like live in relationship which society doesn�t approve and should be discouraged  . Hindus and Muslims were never united in the first place for BJP to divide them by making any fake issues ,nobody denies caste discrimination but congress divides Hindus on caste lines for votes .  You can�t complain caste discrimination and support caste based reservations which is also caste discrimination . Since when criticising Ambedkar is considered demonising him ? If a person from BJP pee on a Dalit , you say all BJP people do that , wow . How about speaking on Sandesh khali where dalit women raped by Muslims ? Accepting multiculturalism and pluralism doesn�t develop any country , devolopment depends and policies and governance . FYI , Japan is ethnically and racially a homogeneous country but not a multicultural country .",1
"�@KumarK-cn1sj�  When it comes to caste based reservation then it's not a discrimination it's a help to people who are discriminated just because their mother belonged to so called lower caste and it will end when u start not use caste like Dome and chamar as abuse when it's not only their work to clean nalis 
Lastly why would u demonise Ambedkar who broke the misconceptions that lower caste can't get education and meant to be your workers, He went above them and with his qualifications seat above and with some upper caste Hindu group leader which made them hate him cause a man with a lower caste is able to influence more than a conservative hindu with lesser education",1
"�@KumarK-cn1sj�  and then About Sandeshkhali then there are 2 hindus and 1 muslim were involved in graping women , it was just that the muslim was more powerful in them and if it was related to religion then why did those hindu grape  with him",1
"�@AtheistIndian2024� 

So you help people who were discriminated by discriminating others ? Caste based reservation system is reverse caste discrimination and it is worst because it is practised by state and against the spirit of equality which should be fundamental principle of constitution of any civilised nation . If I abuse you for being Chamar and refuse to sit beside you , that doesn�t mean govt should give you reservations.   Ambedkar is a brand ambassador of hateful Dalit politics , his follower regularly abuse Hindu gods . He turned a section of Hindu society as its internal enemies . Plus , he didn�t have any role in freedom struggle. In sandeshkhali , it was sheik shajahan�s  goons who have been raping Dalit women for years and I haven�t heard of any Hindu being among them .",0
"�@KumarK-cn1sj�  Then who are sibu hazra and uttam hazra close friends of Shahjahan and partner in crime 
And if muslim were to be doing grapes in India then why India is a hub of grapes think again whole India is to be blamed not a single community
And 2nd that you said that if u abuse and doesn't let me seat it doesn't mean that you should get reservation is just illogical
In America Whites and Blacks collectively fight for the rights of Black and there wasn't any religious justification to that 
Whereas in India it's the religion which justified the caste discrimination ( Don't give stupid explanation that it's not a part of religion please I have enough of these ) and barely any high caste men or group came up to take part in protest 
Ambedkar is a man that just shook the whole pillar of age old slavery and discrimination of people then why don't he get hate from those who didn't find any benefit but lost their luxury
Martin Luther was killed Gandhi was killed 
Everyone who talked and raised voice about equality are being hated and killed and Ambedkar doesn't make any exception and when it comes to religion then as long as abusing religion is concern then we abuse churchil caused Bengal femenine so how do u accept those who ever faced discrimination because of religion to respect the religion
And Baba Saheb has openly criticise Islam and hindu , it's always intellectual and not just blouting hate

Nehruvian socialism was important for us because we had to revive the indigenous industries which were destroyed by the British. Only then can we think of Capitalism and open economy. Adani-Ambani appeasement policy in 60s would have driven the inequality further.

But I agree, there was a flaw. The socialistic policy should have been tapered faster, and by the mid or late 70s, we should have been an open economy, which didn't happen. That's why the slow growth, even now.",1
"@kimjongunvevo� 
Firstly, now the growth is not slow. We are the fastest growing economy in the world.
Nehruvian socialism was bad even on day one. He did not do anything to revive the traditional industries in a financially viable manner. He created white elephants like Gandhi Gramodyog in the name of safeguarding their interests.
He nationalised profitable private sector industries like Air India and turned them into white elephants.
He created a license raj and quota system. An industrialist could be fined for producing more than his quota. 
To top it all, his cronies called this poor rate of growth a Hindu rate of growth. Whereas Nehru hated Hindus.",0
"�@sanjeevsood531� What you are explaining is the consequences of socialism. These are the flaws seen in every socialist state. 

What I mentioned was the problems which would arise if it India didn't have a socialist state.

They would have a monopoly and as I said there will be a state of neo-colonialism.

iam not supporting his Bjp ideology   

But modi is a good leader

Every one calls modi a tea seller

No Money
No power

No proper education 



Let's take rahul
He was born in a rich. Powerful family

He received world class education


Even though he received all of this things he was a failure",1

 think about it sometime
Rahul was born in a rich family but he is facing the election. It is up to the people to elect him. But what about Jai Shah? He is taking advantage of uncle Chowkidar.
No one knows when Modi studied and when he sold tea, but the land belonging to tribal people was given  to Adani at the rate of Re 1 per square foot 6 airport given to adani and SBI gave him 1300 crore for this deal . There are  more things.
Rahul is liked because he is against the capitalist system. Which exploits the poor. The man who wears a suit worth 15 lakhs...he only asks for votes in the name of poverty.And compare the economy growth of UPA and NDA and you will know.

Ram mandir, Modi govt built 262 medical colleges, 15 AIIMS, 6 IIT, 16 IIIT, 7 IIM, 4 crores houses for poor, free treatment for 6 crores poor, 11 crores tap connections, metro in 11 cities, 60000 km highways, 37000 km railway lines, 75 Airports & 10000 Jan Aushadhi Kendra  take a look at our economic growth rate 
Far better than US, CHINA, CANADA, JAPAN, GERMANY AND RUSSIA, 
And lots of development work in under construction for example bullet train, airports, ports, rail lines, electrification, dams, hydropower dams, expressway, highway, clean india mission, more toilets, educational institutions, hospitals, metros and a lot more. And all those development works will so results in coming next decade.

Rahul is the great leader,1
First BBC needs to aware that Rahul Gandhi is not even standing for elections such a poor reporting,1
Can challenge. Definitely. But winning against Modi? No chance,1
He is the reason why Modi wins. An opponent like him is a rare blessing.,1
"Congress needs better leadership, and we need competent opposition. Rahul gandhi is not capable of leading Congress party.",1
"I'm happy to say that western countries are in so depression for PM modi that's why they propagate by media like BBC & others, George soros & many ways. I like this & proud for PM Modi.",1
"i come from a family of congress voters but since 2014 our whole family ( including the extended family ) has been voting for BJP and we will keep voting for BJP for years to come now ...no vote to corrupt anti india anti hindus congress anymore.. there a million reasons to vote for BJP ...they are really good when it comes to infra , they care abotu the country and keep it secure and safe both from inside and outside threats , they work for betterment of the people they build schools , hospitals , roads and institutions on top of that they do not sell their souls to pakistan just to get some minority votes ...i get it there are some muslims who support PFI etc and they become happy when congress licks the feets of pakistanis but to think that majority of indian muslims support pakistan is an insult to patriots muslims ... congress has no vision and no leadership.",1
First Congress should bring democracy in it's own party. So called Prince can't win his own seat and challenging someone who has been CM for 15 years and PM for 10 years now.,1
"I think TATA should buy BBC and dilute British Govt's stake in it  plus its a strategic disinvestment as well considering your recession and urban poverty in London, we are already investing more in UK than most other countries we should set the conditions before investments.",1

BBC wants to win Congress,1
"Wrong Q: Can Pappu challenge NM?
Right Q: Can Pappu speak without comedy?",0
Not even Nehru will be able to save congress in upcoming elections.,1
Why BBC is so worried . High time to change name of BBC,1
Now BBC is promoting Rahul Gandhi  vote for no confidence is certain.,1
"Modi�s contribution to India:
Inflation  - (he increased petrol & diesel and electricity prices which made all commodities expensive too.
Inequality - He transferred 16lakh crores to super-rich billionaires. He didn't waive farmer loans and was responsible for 1 Lakh farmer deaths.
Injustice: Modi sold PSU, airports, and seaports for pennies (paise) , and people lost jobs & reservations. Modi didn't fill govt 40 lakh central govt jobs to block people from getting job reservations. Modi spends 200 crores per day on useless trips while 200 crore people struggle to travel by packed trains.",0
Manipur was okay under pm atal vajpayee under man Mohan Singh but under Modi Manipur has come down to worse period ever. I'm from Manipur and words itself are too light to described what is going on in Manipur. Manipur has brokern down completely. But he is the prime minister of India should he not raise an issue or give concern but what was he doing? Or did he forget right now Manipur is under India? Or did he think Manipur  is part of burma or china,1

"Prince Rahul won't win it bbc....he is a good man but not at all a good politician. His Congress lost 90% of election under his leadership...he is not even confident enough to say that he stand to become pm . And if people think religion make bjp won then bjp would have won since 1947 if formed . Noone votes to people 3 times in 15 yrs  just on religion unless you are a Pakistani. Development, growth and lot of things are getting better ...I am a youth and I can see it clearly statistically speaking.",1
"Rshul is a decent human being, tough resilient and straight. Unlike modi whovis wicked",0
"The worlds largest Democracy I was so proud of that .But if we observe the scenarios happening right now  . We have that ability understand Things going on(politics ).we can understand the autocratic and destructive actions of the government in power�Ed,Electoral bonds,the farmers ,Manipur,CAA�.

"He ,single handedly, assure bjp victory ",0
"Now modj will win since he is raiding mlas houses and buying mlas left and right. But next election, the sam epeolle cheering fir him will be protesting against him. Have patience.  Time reveals reality in many ways. Modi atrocities will end.",1
"Can he challenge- Yes ..its his democratic right..and unlike propoganda..democracy is thriving in india...you can call names and even abuse modi ...last time i checked dictatorships did nt allow that.
Will it make a difference.-yes but in favour of Modi because Rahul is highly incompetant as a leader.",1
long live INC!,1
After so many years since independence what have congress done for bharat mata nothing but looting and destruction of sanatana dharma they should never ever rule bharat again long live bharat mata dharma,1
Actually rahul gandhi is soft campaigner for modi,1
"Bharat Todo Yatra...Desh bachawo Deshdrohi Congres hatao....
HINDUSTAN JAAAAAAGO United  HINDUSTAN need BJP MODI for strong HINDUSTAN ?",1
Maybe Rahul gandhi is not a great politican like as modiji. But I feel is a good person just that if  he wanted serve people he could have worked for some social cause uplift the people. Politics is only ruining his image & mockery of education he had.  Again it is his choose still feel he would have better off doing something else.,1
BBC found only a Muslim to ask for. Maybe they know 15 percent isnt a minority the way congress and other projects,0
this party has unhealthy obsession with Gandhi family and Rahul Gandhi.,0
"Rahul Gandhi ji is doing the Best for the country people.
He is strengthing the people to Woke Up.",1
"The same man who others regard as a teen, grey beard and all, who does not know day from night, and was kicked out after a file of defamation ",0
"Indian politics is one of the most corrupt and violent in the world, for Tiger Rahul, he should get out, the National Congress has no future in India under current platocracy, RIP India.",0
Rahul Gandhi is not capable for a peon post,0
Nothing wrong with EVM. Besides Modiji will win with or without EVM because he is progressing india,1
Khangress marnrega rewdi voters trying there best to make rajkumar as PM,1
Lol Rahul and his supporters are a joke. Amethi will vote Smriti Irani back. Rahul has to run off to Kerala and win Wayanad or he wont be able to get into the new parliament building after May 2024.,1
"Yes there is an issue regarding religion with BJP, but when it comes to development, I see BJP as game changer of Indian economy, they have won the election not only on religion basis, don't disregard indians talking this sh*t  .",0
"I am from a Congressi freedom fighter family.  No one can be more congress supporter than my family.
But after seeing that nothing is done by Congress, we and our entire family votes for BJP and will continue to do so.
People should understand that they used to vote for Congress that is great but right now Congress is incapable of anything.
They are just trying to divide the country based on religion and language.
Again this is just my personal opinion. But all support to modiji and BJP.
And BBC keep your pathetic nose out of our country's internal issues. First go and handle the messed up situations in your country and the countries which you people have messed up.
Such a shameless news agency....you can't handle even one good thing happening in any part of the world be it Bharat or El Salvador.",1
"First BBC paid Dhruv Rathi to make a video on PM Modi calling him a ""dictator"" and now trying different tactics to influence the foolish liberals of India ",1
"Person love this country love modiji. Person hate modiji hate this country. Help him to help us.
(VOTE ).. Rahul gandhi guarantee that Modiji will be our next PM.",0
"Modi jii did not developed the India, How Singh jii did.

If anyone listening to Modi, I am saying with dam sure they are going to vote for him. Because he is a good speaker.

We need a young dynamic leader someone from opposition not Rahul�",1
Congress numbers may increase but if they win this election's then they have to defeat BJP in the hindi heart which seems impossible at the moment,1
"Rahul Gandhi campaigns like that union leader who is always finding flaws in the system, but never has any long term solutions. Always complaining, always b*tching about how the system is failing the poor, but never ever proposes what strategies he has to uplift the poor, and what he will do differently from the Modi government which is already doing more for the poor than all past governments have done. Rahul Gandhi is simply clueless about the country's economy. All he knows is to play divisive caste politics and stoke fear and hatred among the poor against the rich.",0
He might even lose his own MP seat this time.,1
Anyone challenging Modi should have a very strong false narrative. Like how they fooled people in the name of Gujarat model. We all know it is just a sham.,1
BBC working overtime to somehow make Rahul Gandhi appear a strong contender,1
BJP has built up second biggest road network of world but India is huge giant nation,1
"rahul gandhi a comedian a joker a star BJP campaigner a national security threat , evergreen  young leader (53)  many people see him differently",1
I feel how idiot the editors of bbc are! Writing this kind of title is the funniest thing I have seen so far on the context of politics. Comparing raga with namo,0

Full support of Rahul Gandhi,1
Other way around. Modiji our best PM,1

"Despite being the most uneducated, orthodox, and primitive Prime Minister India has ever had, Narendra Modi's leadership seems impervious to change. Regardless of what Rahul Gandhi may attempt, the majority of this nation's mentality has been completely Rotten, marked by religious divisiveness and bias. BJP supporters, blinded by allegiance, overlook the country's pressing issues, such as soaring inflation, rampant unemployment, and ill-conceived policies like Demonetisation and the controversial CAA and Farm bills. Additionally, BJP's involvement in scandals like the Rafael and Adani scams further tarnishes its reputation. India's dismal rankings in global indices like the World Hunger Index and Press Freedom Index reflect the ongoing challenges. Despite facing exorbitant prices for essentials like petrol and LPG, BJP supporters remain staunch, illustrating a concerning level of communalism and apathy towards economic hardships.",1

Hello bro. I would just say it's a propoganda video. In villages there might be some infra issues. But when you come to urban areas like where I live it's absolutely fantastic in all aspects. Modi has done amazing on all counts from hammering China to GDP touching 4 trillion USD from semiconductor plants to space landing and much more. It's only on job creation front he is weak.,1
�@prabhatranjan362� thanks for the reply.,1
"�@colinpace1987� Modi has failed to give jobs and investment. Many people are jobless. But India today is radicalised on sectarian Hindu Muslim lines. BJP is a hardliner party with low morals but better functioning of government. They take quick actions and protect larger community interests.
The Congress party has better democratic values but their operatives are poor, outdated and prone to scams, affirmative actions and corruption.
BJP hasnt delivered prosperity. Thats why they divide on religion.",1
